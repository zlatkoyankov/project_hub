# BuildCalc

BuildCalc is a production-style Angular website with free calculators for common US home improvement, renovation, landscaping, and construction estimates.

Tagline: **Plan smarter. Build with confidence.**

## What BuildCalc includes

- Responsive landing page and calculator search.
- Calculator directory with category filtering.
- Short calculator URLs such as `/calculators/gravel-calculator`; the full directory is at `/calculators/all-calculators`.
- Six working calculators:
  - Gravel
  - Paint
  - Tile
  - Concrete
  - Square footage
  - Mulch
- Unit selectors for imperial and metric measurements where practical (feet, inches, meters, centimeters, and millimeters for small measurements).
- A site-wide US customary / Metric selector in the header. Changing it converts current calculator measurements and updates compatible result units.
- Material guides and supporting pages (about, contact, privacy, terms, disclaimer).
- Contact page links directly to `hello@zyankov.eu` using the visitor's email app.
- SSR-ready Angular app (standalone components + lazy routes).
- Known calculator, guide, and information routes are prerendered for static hosting.
- Route-specific title + meta description handling via a centralized SEO service.
- `robots.txt` and a maintainable `sitemap.xml`.
- Unit tests for core calculation logic.

## Project structure

- [src/app/core/](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/core) — SEO utilities and global app logic
- [src/app/data/](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/data) — calculator metadata and categories
- [src/app/pages/](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/pages) — page-level components (home, directory, calculator, content pages)
- [src/app/utils/](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/utils) — deterministic calculation utilities + tests
- [src/styles.scss](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/styles.scss) — design tokens and shared styling
- [public/](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/public) — static assets (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`)

## Add another calculator

1. Add calculator metadata in [src/app/data/calculators.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/data/calculators.ts).
2. Add input defaults and field definitions in [src/app/pages/calculator.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/pages/calculator.ts).
3. Add a typed utility function in [src/app/utils/calculations.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/utils/calculations.ts).
4. Wire calculation handling in the `calculate()` switch in [src/app/pages/calculator.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/pages/calculator.ts).
5. Add tests in [src/app/utils/calculations.spec.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/utils/calculations.spec.ts).
6. Ensure route title/description behavior in [src/app/app.routes.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/app.routes.ts).

## SEO configuration

Route SEO metadata is set in [src/app/app.routes.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/app.routes.ts), and applied by [SeoService](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/core/seo.service.ts).

To enable canonical URLs, set `SITE_BASE_URL` in [src/app/core/seo.service.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/core/seo.service.ts), for example:

```ts
export const SITE_BASE_URL = 'https://www.your-domain.com';
```

`public/sitemap.xml` uses route paths and should be updated alongside route changes.

## SSR / prerendering notes

- SSR is enabled via Angular SSR setup in this project.
- Server render mode is configured in [src/app/app.routes.server.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/app.routes.server.ts).
- The wildcard route remains server-rendered for unknown paths; known calculator and guide slugs are prerendered from the project data.

## AdSense integration (after approval)

BuildCalc intentionally does **not** load ad scripts by default.

No empty ad placeholders are shown. Before adding advertising, configure appropriate consent
controls, update the privacy policy to match the actual services, and keep ads separate from
calculator inputs and results.

After AdSense approval:
1. Add your official AdSense script to [src/index.html](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/index.html).
2. Add your publisher ID and ad unit config.
3. Keep ad placements separate from form controls and result actions.
4. Re-review the privacy page in [src/app/pages/content.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/pages/content.ts) to accurately reflect real cookie/advertising behavior.

## Calculation assumptions and limitations

- All calculators provide planning estimates, not engineering or contractual guarantees.
- Unit selectors convert entered measurements into consistent internal US customary units before calculating; square-footage results also show square meters.
- The header unit preference applies across calculator pages for the current browser session. US customary is the starting default.
- Density, coverage, product packaging, compaction, and site conditions vary.
- Waste allowance should be validated per project.
- Concrete volume outputs are not structural design guidance.

## Formula validation guidance

Recommended validation workflow:
- Verify the formula implementation in [src/app/utils/calculations.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/utils/calculations.ts).
- Run [src/app/utils/calculations.spec.ts](/Users/zlatko/WORK/calculators/src/app/utils/calculations.spec.ts) with `npm test`.
- Compare sample results against independent hand calculations.
- Confirm supplier-specific inputs (coverage, density, package size) before final purchase planning.

## Theming

Colors and fonts follow the project-hub palette (green ink, soft paper, coral accent; DM Sans). Light and dark themes are CSS-variable tokens in `src/styles.scss` (`:root` and `:root[data-theme='dark']`). `ThemeService` picks the saved choice or the system preference, persists it in `localStorage`, and an inline script in `index.html` prevents a flash on load. Use the header toggle to switch.

## Shared design system

Tokens, base frame and theme logic live in `design-system/` (see its README) so other projects can reuse the same style. `tokens.css` is loaded from `angular.json`.

## Deployment

The site is published at `https://zyankov.eu/calculators`. Build with `npm run build:prod`, which sets `--base-href /calculators/`. Canonical URLs, Open Graph, JSON-LD and the sitemap use `SITE_BASE_URL` in `src/app/core/seo.service.ts`. Image paths are relative so they work under the sub-path.
